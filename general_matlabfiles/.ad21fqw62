PTB-WARNING: Startup test of beamposition queries for high precision timestamping detected problems on your graphics card + driver combo.
PTB-INFO: Seems beamposition queries are unsupported whenever the display is in a vertical retrace state.
PTB-INFO: I will enable a work-around which should satisfy the timing needs of most applications, ie.
PTB-INFO: robust and jitter-free deterministic timestamps. However, all reported timestamps may have a
PTB-INFO: constant offset of up to the duration of the vertical blanking interval (max 1 msec worst case)
PTB-INFO: of your display. Read 'help BeampositionQueries' on how you can remove that bias by some manual
PTB-INFO: intervention, should you need that last bit of accuracy. A second drawback is increased cpu load,
PTB-INFO: which may cause louder air-fan noise due to heat production and lower battery runtime of laptops.


PTB-INFO: This is Psychtoolbox-3 for Microsoft Windows, under GNU/Octave-3 (Version 3.0.9 - Build date: May 21 2012).

PTB-INFO: some restrictions. See file 'License.txt' in the Psychtoolbox root folder for the exact licensing conditions.

PTB-INFO: The detected endline of the vertical blank interval is equal or lower than the startline. This indicates
PTB-INFO: that i couldn't detect the duration of the vertical blank interval and won't be able to correct timestamps
PTB-INFO: for it. This will introduce a very small and constant offset (typically << 1 msec). Read 'help BeampositionQueries'
PTB-INFO: for how to correct this, should you really require that last few microseconds of precision.
PTB-INFO: Btw. this can also mean that your systems beamposition queries are slightly broken. It may help timing precision to
PTB-INFO: enable the beamposition workaround, as explained in 'help ConserveVRAM', section 'kPsychUseBeampositionQueryWorkaround'.
